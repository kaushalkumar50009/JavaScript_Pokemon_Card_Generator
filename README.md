# Pokemon Card Generator

## Description

The Pokemon Card Generator is a web application that generates random Pokemon cards. Each card displays information about a randomly selected Pokemon, such as its name, hit points (HP), image, type(s), and various stats like attack, defense, and speed. The card's design and color scheme are based on the primary type of the selected Pokemon.

## Features

- Dynamically set the card's design and color based on the Pokemon's primary type.
- Click the "Get Pokemon" button to generate a new card with a different Pokemon.
- Provides information such as HP, name, image, type(s), and stats.
